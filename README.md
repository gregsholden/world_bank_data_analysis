# Project Overview

This analysis was used as part of a Milestone Project for the University of Michigan's Master of Applied Data Science program.

The project involved proprocessing and analysis of the World Bank's World Development Indicators ("WDI") dataset.

#  Description of Dataset

The WDI dataset contains over 1,400 time series indicators (some of which span over 50 years) for over 200 economies.  Primary data themes within the dataset include:  Poverty and Inequality, People, Environment, Economy, States and Markets, and Global Links.

# The Assignment

The purpose of the assignment was to analyze at least two of the primary data themes described above and craft a compelling story.

My analysis frames the discussion from the perspective of a hypothetical multinational corporation that is looking to select a location for new manufacturing facility.   The company narrows its search down to 18 countries across 3 regions -- Southeast Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe -- and must make a decision based on a combination of Economic and People indicators.
